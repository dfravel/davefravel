      <description>I spent 44 years of my life oblivious to quinoa. For 43 of those years I had never even heard of it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t discover it until I was at a family cookout and someone brought a quinoa salad.
In all honesty, the salad was pretty bad. The person who brought it overcooked the quinoa. The consistency was closer to rice pudding than anything resembling what quinoa is supposed to be, but it opened my eyes to a new potential side dish.</description>
