      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t always give Cape Cod enough credit. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to bash the place I&amp;rsquo;ve called home for the past 20 years:
 There aren&amp;rsquo;t enough jobs. There isn&amp;rsquo;t enough opportunity for young families. The cost of living is incredibly high. We have a little bit of a heroin problem. The median age is closing in on 50, and showing no signs of reversing course  In short - I spend a lot of time thinking about what it would be like to live somewhere else.</description>
