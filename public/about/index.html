<h2 id="a-little-bit-about-me">A little bit about me</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve made it to this page you obviously have too much free time or my name made the news in some horrific fashion and you need to get some basic background on me. Either way - welcome to my latest website.</p>

<p>Over the past 10 years I&rsquo;ve had a few different personal sites - nearly all of them are shuttered, sold or forgotten. I&rsquo;d love to promise that I&rsquo;ll commit to writing on this site regularly, but if history has taught me anything it&rsquo;s that I have no idea what next week has in store. For now, I  promise to update this as often as possible.</p>

<!-- ## Being a Dad
I'm blessed to have three incredible kids. At the time of this writing Caitlin is 21 and a senior at Framingham State; Keely is 17 and a senior at Barnstable High School; Colin is 13 and an 8th grader at Barnstable High School. They are the most important people in my life and I'm so proud of the young adults they've become.

## My Girlfriend/Partner
A very close second in the "most important people in my life" category is Sue - my girlfriend, business partner, running partner, beer-tasting teammate and the reason **Running** made the list of topics that matter to me. I'd like to live a long life so I can spend it by her side.

## Running
I used to run (a lot), but the stress of building a company, going through a divorce, raising teenagers, selling the company I built and then struggling with the remaining debt forced me into the toxic mindset of "I have no time for myself. I need to be working or raising the kids." There was no time for me. The weight piled on and the mental health slid to dark places. At my annual Doctor's visit this June, my primary care physician went through my weight history (I've been a patient since 2007). He was concerned with the upward trend, but I was more concerned because his office scale is broken. My weight was actually 20lbs higher than his records indicated. It was time for a change. It was time to start running again. It will take a long time to get back to 50 miles a week, and probably longer to consider running another marathon, but for now I'm enjoying the feeling that comes with running 4-5 days/week .... even if my pace is 2 minutes (ok, 3 minutes) slower than it was 10 years ago. -->

<!-- ## My Job
I spent seven years building 20Mile Technologies. Through most of those seven years other people did the software development and I handled sales and administration. That changed in 2013 - I sold the company and co-founded [bluegear labs](http://bluegear.io) with Sue. After a slow start where we supported old ExpressionEngine sites, built WordPress sites and maintained a couple of legacy applications we've finally turned the corner and are developing large web applications. Sure, we still support EE, WordPress and a few other custom CMS platforms, but the bulk of our time is spent developing brand new applications. We write nearly all of them in [Laravel](http://laravel.com) - quite possibly the most elegant framework I've ever worked with.

## My Tech Background
Some of you will probably come to this page after stumbling across a technical blog post that I hacked together, and you'll want to know a little more about my technical background.

Like most 40-somethings, my history is a pot-pourri of languages and platforms and the journey to this point has been winding with occasional breaks to pursue other interests. I've had years where I didn't write a single line of code, and I've enjoyed months immersed in the newest web technologies.

As far as quick summary - I've been doing "something with computers" since 1990. Most of my "get-paid-for-it" time has been spent in Aldus Pagemaker (remember that?), dBase, Paradox for DOS (seriously), MS Access, MS SQL Server, Classic ASP, C#, ASP.NET, PHP (including frameworks), MySQL and JavaScript (or JS framework du jour).  I don't have a personal favorite, although if I was forced to choose it would be MS SQL Server. I don't care about the latest and greatest "best practices." I've had too many jobs and been involved with too many projects to presume that there's a best way to do anything. In my experience, every way is a good way that could probably be a little better, but you won't know how to make it better until you make a few mistakes (a metaphor for life). -->

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to get in touch with me the best bet is via email - <a href="mailto:dave@bluegear.io">dave@bluegear.io</a>. You can also call or text - 508-776-4019. All of my social media accounts are in the footer of this page, but I can&rsquo;t guarantee that I&rsquo;ll be active on those all the time. I try to take a break from them every once in a while for my own sanity.</p>
