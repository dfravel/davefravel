<h2 id="it-s-not-me-it-s-you-ok-maybe-it-s-me">It&rsquo;s not me. It&rsquo;s you (ok - maybe it&rsquo;s me).</h2>

<p>It would be the same routine - repeated every hour or two - a round robin of time-wasters. First it would be Facebook, then Instagram and then LinkedIn. If there was nothing of interest or comment-worthy, I&rsquo;d open Reddit and scan through the front page .. and then the second page. All in an attempt to put off whatever I should be doing at that moment.</p>

<p>The four websites accounted for 90% of my non-work, online usage and I can honestly say they weren&rsquo;t adding anything of value to my life. They were actually doing me harm.</p>

<p>In October, I decided that it was time for a change. I needed to quit them all.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t worry about deleting Instagram. I barely posted any pictures of my own and could only deal with so many pictures of other people&rsquo;s vacations, memes or selfies.</p>

<p>Facebook was a little harder, but I breathed a huge sigh of relief when I finally deactivated it. It was having an impact on my mental health and sense of self-worth. Deleting it from my phone was a form of therapy. I was a part of some groups that only communicated via Facebook, but if there was something important or worth knowing I had other ways to find out the information.</p>

<p>I thought I&rsquo;d have a tough time without LinkedIn. It took 10 years to &ldquo;collect&rdquo; about a thousand connections, but the more I thought about it, the harder it became to justify keeping. In all of my years on LinkedIn, I can&rsquo;t recall a single piece of business that I gained through it. I recommended plenty of people and introduced more than my fair share, but as far as tangible, measurable benefit? I didn&rsquo;t have any.</p>

<p><strong>Update: June 4, 2017</strong>: It&rsquo;s been about 5 months since I wrote this post. I&rsquo;ve survived without Instagram and LinkedIn.  I only check Reddit at night. Unfortunately, I was (sort of) forced to re-activate my Facebook account last month. I held off as long as I could, but after hearing too many pieces of family news 2nd and 3rd hand I realized that for most of my extended family and friends, Facebook has become the way we keep up with each other.  The kids would keep me informed on what&rsquo;s happening, but after losing count of how many times I asked &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s happening with &hellip;?&rdquo; I decided it was time to break down and re-join Facebook.</p>

<p>I still haven&rsquo;t posted anything new, and I&rsquo;ve unliked all of the pages/groups/interests that were filling up my timeline. I also unfollowed people that I don&rsquo;t know all that well so that my feed is (mostly) people that I know very well IRL or family members.</p>
