<p>Earlier this week I hit a roadblock. I was frustrated with my chosen tech stack and felt like I was missing out on a much broader world of opportunities. I started down a new path of researching Elm and React with a promise to myself to learn something new.</p>

<p>After an hour with React it was obvious that the barrier to entry to get comfortable with the language was too high. If I suddenly find myself with a project where I absolutely need React I&rsquo;ll invest a weekend to achieve at least a minimal understanding, but for this exercise I wanted to dive in, get comfortable, and have something to show for my efforts within a week.</p>

<h2 id="enter-elm">Enter Elm</h2>

<p>After an hour with Elm I was able to do that. I handed over $49 to Nicole at Mike at <a href="https://pragmaticstudio.com/">The Pragmatic Studio</a> and spent an evening going through <a href="https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/elm">their step by step guide</a> to learn the concepts and some of the syntax. It all clicked, but what&rsquo;s better, it opened my eyes to a huge community of developers that I wasn&rsquo;t aware of. My dive into Elm led me to Elixir, Erlang and Phoenix.</p>

<h2 id="and-why-not-elixir">And Why Not Elixir</h2>

<p>I enjoyed the teaching style of Mike and Nicole so much that I added their <a href="https://pragmaticstudio.com/elixir">Elixir course</a> to my account and have been working through that. A ton of it is above my head and I have a feeling that I&rsquo;ll be re-watching a lot of these, but discovering the language and community has been a breath of fresh air.</p>

<h2 id="if-we-re-using-elixir-let-s-use-phoenix">If we&rsquo;re using Elixir, let&rsquo;s use Phoenix</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m coming to this new world from the relative comfort of a PHP framework - <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a>. I don&rsquo;t know enough about Phoenix yet to say that it&rsquo;s a replacement for Laravel (or Rails for that matter), but developing on top of Phoenix feels similar to developing within Laravel</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>I have a ton of bookmarked links saved in my Todoist account. I&rsquo;m going to plow through as much as I can through the weekend until Sue is home tomorrow night.</p>
