                    <p>It was a bit of a loaded question that I posed to friends and followers on Twitter - &ldquo;if you have 10 hours that you can dedicate to self-improvement in your profession, do you dedicate that time to getting better at the things you already know, <strong>or</strong> do you put the time into learning something new?&ldquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get a lot of responses, but the ones I did get weren&rsquo;t a surprise. They mostly revolved around the idea of &ldquo;step away from the computer&rdquo;, &ldquo;get more exercise&rdquo;, &ldquo;spend time outside&rdquo;, &ldquo;unplug&rdquo;.</p>

<p>All of those are great suggestions and I should heed the advice, but I&rsquo;m interested in the cliched &ldquo;20% time.&rdquo; If your boss gives you one day each week to do anything you&rsquo;d like related to your profession, you&rsquo;re not going to say &ldquo;Thanks! I&rsquo;m going to sleep late, enjoy a long hike in the woods, read a book, and start cocktail hour around 3:30.&rdquo; No - you&rsquo;re going to explore some of the fringes of your knowledge base (at least you should if you want to keep the paychecks rolling in).</p>

<p>In my case, I know enough about 6-7 different technical areas to make things work and make a decent living. I feel comfortable with MS SQL Server, MySQL, Craft CMS, Laravel, WordPress, LAMP-based hosting, e-commerce (concepts, requirements and programming), and most PHP-based content management systems that if a client needs help in these areas I can jump in and get the job done. I don&rsquo;t consider myself an expert in any of them, but on a 1-10 scale where the average technophobe is a 1, I&rsquo;m a solid 7.</p>

<p>So when the opportunity to get better is available I struggle with the decision of &ldquo;push myself to an 8 in X or start at a 1 in Y.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>In my case, I&rsquo;m taking the &ldquo;start at a 1 in Y&rdquo; approach. There are too many other technology paths to grow stale in what I already know.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every 3-6 months a new &ldquo;OMG YOU NEED TO BE USING THIS PACKAGE&rdquo; seems to pop up out of nowhere and the lemmings shift their focus to that shiny new toy. I&rsquo;m not going to fall for that. I&rsquo;d prefer to jump into something every 12-18 months after something has been around for a while and seems to have developed a solid foundation.</p>

<p>With that in mind, my 20% time will be spent on a a couple programming languages and concepts - Elm and React/Redux.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking into Elm because I like the higher-level, functional programming concepts. I&rsquo;m looking into React because &hellip; well, because it seems like the entire world is looking into React and I feel like I need to jump onboard (not quite lemming-like &hellip; I hope)</p>

<p>I might keep a running account of my learning experiences. For now, I&rsquo;m satisfied to have a direction and a decision.</p>
