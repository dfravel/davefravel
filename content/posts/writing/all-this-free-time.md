Nothing special or long-winded in this post.

After a talk with my old friend JJ this morning, I've decided that it's time to figure out ways to fill my free-time with positive activities. Whether it's writing, reading, exercise, time with family, or volunteering, I need to find better things to do with my time. Up to this point, free time was spent binge-watching shows on Netflix, scrolling through social media sites, and ticking off hours with mindless junk.

I'm not waiting for January 1. I'm resolving to do better now.
