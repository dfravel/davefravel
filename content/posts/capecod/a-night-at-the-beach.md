I don't always give Cape Cod enough credit. It's easy to bash the place I've called home for the past 20 years:

- There aren't enough jobs.
- There isn't enough opportunity for young families.
- The cost of living is incredibly high.
- We have a little bit of a heroin problem.
- The median age is closing in on 50, and showing no signs of reversing course

In short - I spend a lot of time thinking about what it would be like to live somewhere else.

But then I take a drive with Sue and stumble across a beach at high tide. We didn't plan this. We simply ate too much at dinner and decided to walk some of it off. We turned into the National Seashore, parked our car and walked down the path to Coast Guard Beach. This picture from my iPhone 6S doesn't do it justice. I wasn't able to get a picture of the 20 seals playing in the surf, and you can't hear how loud the waves actually were, but it's places like this that will keep me happily on the Cape for a while longer.
