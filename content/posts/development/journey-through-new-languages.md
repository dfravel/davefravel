Earlier this week I hit a roadblock. I was frustrated with my chosen tech stack and felt like I was missing out on a much broader world of opportunities. I started down a new path of researching Elm and React with a promise to myself to learn something new.

After an hour with React it was obvious that the barrier to entry to get comfortable with the language was too high. If I suddenly find myself with a project where I absolutely need React I'll invest a weekend to achieve at least a minimal understanding, but for this exercise I wanted to dive in, get comfortable, and have something to show for my efforts within a week.

## Enter Elm
After an hour with Elm I was able to do that. I handed over $49 to Nicole at Mike at [The Pragmatic Studio](https://pragmaticstudio.com/) and spent an evening going through [their step by step guide](https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/elm) to learn the concepts and some of the syntax. It all clicked, but what's better, it opened my eyes to a huge community of developers that I wasn't aware of. My dive into Elm led me to Elixir, Erlang and Phoenix.

## And Why Not Elixir
I enjoyed the teaching style of Mike and Nicole so much that I added their [Elixir course](https://pragmaticstudio.com/elixir) to my account and have been working through that. A ton of it is above my head and I have a feeling that I'll be re-watching a lot of these, but discovering the language and community has been a breath of fresh air.

## If we're using Elixir, let's use Phoenix
I'm coming to this new world from the relative comfort of a PHP framework - [Laravel](https://laravel.com). I don't know enough about Phoenix yet to say that it's a replacement for Laravel (or Rails for that matter), but developing on top of Phoenix feels similar to developing within Laravel

## Next Steps
I have a ton of bookmarked links saved in my Todoist account. I'm going to plow through as much as I can through the weekend until Sue is home tomorrow night.
