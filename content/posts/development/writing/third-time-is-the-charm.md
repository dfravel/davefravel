I reached a breaking point yesterday. I got sucked into a twitter war about a conference that I never intended to attend, and that before yesterday I had never heard of.

After 30 minutes of reading random blog posts and tweet storms from people I don't know, I had had enough. I was angry at the situation, but mostly angry with myself for allowing this issue to suck me in. This was the problem with social media in general and twitter in particular. It dragged me in and took over all of my attention. I knew it was time for something drastic.

I deactivated my Twitter account.

Sure - I know that I have 30 days to reactivate it. As a matter of fact, I put a note on my calendar for September 20 to see how I feel, but I have to admit, the freedom I've felt since 12pm yesterday is exhilirating. I read for pleasure and education last night. I didn't check twitter to see if I got any likes/replies/DMs/new followers. I felt (and continue to feel) renewed and clear-headed.

I hope this lasts.
