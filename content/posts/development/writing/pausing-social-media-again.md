One of my resolutions in the New Year was to [pause social media](/posts/pausing-social-media/). I lasted a few days away from Twitter; significantly longer for other social media. By July I was back on all of the "standard" social media apps and time-wasting sites:

-   Twitter
-   Facebook
-   LinkedIn
-   Instagram
-   Reddit

Coincidentally, my energy level, focus, attention to detail and overall mood all took a hit in July.

It doesn't help that our President uses social media to get his "unique" message out to the country, and it _really_ doesn't help that his "unique" message comes with an exhausting level of hate and vitriol.

I found myself begging for a break from all of it, but unable to look away.

The push I needed was on a podcast, that I ironically discovered on Twitter. [Jeffrey Way](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way) tweeted this yesterday and I listened to it last night:

It was the push I needed. Last night, I deleted all social media apps from my iPhone and iPad. I downloaded a couple new books onto my Kindle app, I bookmarked a few articles to read and I decided to once again pause my social media habit.

As with the last time, I don't know how long this self-imposed exile will last, but it's been 18 hours and I actually feel cleaner and healthier.
