One of the reasons that I decided to start writing online again was to do my part to stop the rise of tweetstorms and other nonsense on Twitter.

Don't get me wrong. I love Twitter and the opportunity it provides to get ideas out quickly to the masses, but it's not the best medium for deeper thinking. When faced with the limitations of 140 characters, too many people have taken to starting tweets with 1/x and then going on for as long as it takes to get their fragmented thoughts out of their heads and into ours. This has caused me more frustration as I attempt to wind my way through someone's tweets looking for 1/, 2/, 3/ while ignoring the inevitable replies and other retweets mixed in. It's the worst possible format for deep thinking.

I'm not going to pretend that there will be lots of deep thoughts in this blog, but I can promise that if a topic requires more than 140 (or 280) characters I'll probably write a quick blog post about it.
