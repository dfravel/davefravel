So it's only been two days, but I can't believe how much better I feel after deactivating my Twitter account.

Some of the benefits:

-   I manage my time so much better
-   I'm less distracted
-   I'm a lot less angry/sad/frustated
-   I can read a story online and develop my own opinion on it. The hive mind isn't telling me how I should feel/think.

Case in point - Kirsten Gillibrand dropped out of the 2020 presidential race today. I read that article, thought "that's too bad, but I'm not surprised" and I moved on. My guess is that this story is trending on Twitter with loud opinions on all sides of the story. Bottom line - there were over 20 candidates, and now there's one less. That's the only amount of thought that I should give to this.
